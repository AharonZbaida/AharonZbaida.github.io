# LinkedIn About Section - Strategic Positioning (Data Analyst)

## Recommended Text (Copy & Paste to LinkedIn)

I analyze structured data to support business decisions in financial services, operations, and project management. My focus is on SQL-driven analysis, clear data visualization, and turning complex datasets into actionable insights.

Over 15 years, I've worked with financial market data (224K+ records across multiple instruments), construction project budgets and cost tracking, and R&D laboratory data. I build reproducible analysis workflows, create dashboards for stakeholder reporting, and apply statistical rigor to ensure findings are trustworthy — including honest reporting when the data doesn't support a hypothesis.

My technical toolkit includes SQL (PostgreSQL, DuckDB), Python (pandas, NumPy), Tableau, Excel, and statistical analysis methods. I've built interactive dashboards, automated data pipelines, and analysis reports across multiple domains.

My background also includes construction project management (18 years of budget tracking, cost estimation, and financial reporting), materials science R&D, and biomedical engineering research (published in American Journal of Hypertension). This cross-domain experience gives me strong analytical instincts and the ability to communicate findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Currently seeking remote Data Analyst opportunities, particularly in financial services, construction technology, insurance, or any organization that values deep analytical skills and domain expertise. Open to full-time, contract, and consulting engagements.

## Employment Gap Narrative

### The Story (weave into About sections and be ready for interviews)

**2002–2020: Parallel career tracks**
- Construction operations with extensive cost analysis, budget management, and financial reporting (Anitani LLC / Zbaida LLC)
- Simultaneous data and algorithm work (Anitani Solutions, Concord Wealth, Daren Labs, Peoples' FinTech)
- This was intentional: construction provided steady income while building data skills

**2020–2024: Transition period**
- Shifted full-time to data analysis and research
- Wound down construction operations (formally ended 2024)
- Deep independent work: analyzed 224K+ financial records, built statistical validation frameworks, created dashboards

**2024–Present: Actively seeking DA roles**
- Continued independent data analysis and research projects
- Building Tableau portfolio (dashboards on Tableau Public)
- Targeting remote opportunities where domain expertise in financial + operational data adds value

**Key narrative points for interviews:**
- "I've always been a data person — even in construction, I was the one building the spreadsheets, tracking costs, and analyzing project performance"
- "My 18 years in construction gave me real-world experience with operational data — budgets, schedules, cost variance — that most data analysts only see in textbooks"
- "I made a deliberate transition to focus fully on data analysis, and I bring a unique combination of technical skills and domain knowledge"

### Industries Where the Gap Becomes a Strength

1. **PropTech / Construction Tech** — "I have 18 years of construction data experience that no bootcamp grad can match"
2. **FinTech** — "I've analyzed hundreds of thousands of financial records with statistical rigor"
3. **Insurance** — "I understand risk, cost estimation, and regulatory compliance from both the data and operations side"
4. **Real Estate** — "I've managed property projects and understand the financial data behind real estate operations"

## Strategic Notes

**For Hiring Managers:** First 2–3 lines are critical. They see data analysis + SQL + financial data + actionable insights immediately.

**For Recruiters:** Keywords are front-loaded: SQL, data analysis, Python, Tableau, financial data, dashboards, statistical analysis.

**For Consulting/Partnerships:** Final paragraph mentions breadth and remote availability.

**Domain Signal:** Construction experience is reframed as "cost analysis, budget tracking, financial reporting" — data language that resonates with DA hiring managers.

**Honesty Signal:** Mentioning "honest reporting when the data doesn't support a hypothesis" signals integrity and analytical maturity — a strong differentiator from candidates who only show wins.
