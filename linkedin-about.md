## Recommended Text (Copy & Paste to LinkedIn)

I build production ML systems for structured financial data supporting credit, pricing, and high-stakes decision-making in regulated environments. My focus is on tabular modeling, rigorous time-aware evaluation, and end-to-end pipelines that ship.

Over 15 years, I've worked as an early or sole ML contributor delivering models that handle non-stationary data, prevent lookahead bias, and survive regulatory scrutiny. I've built walk-forward validation frameworks, regime-aware evaluation systems, and feature engineering services ensuring consistency from training through deployment. Technologies include XGBoost, LightGBM, PyTorch, Docker, and production data pipelines.

Recent work includes reinforcement learning systems processing 7,800+ ticks/second, statistical validation frameworks for long-horizon financial outcomes, and research on market microstructure with honest reporting of null results. I value reproducibility, statistical rigor, and systems that operate reliably in production.

My background also spans construction project management (200+ workers, multi-million dollar budgets), materials science, and biomedical engineering—experience that informs how I approach complex technical projects, team coordination, and delivery under constraints.

Currently exploring opportunities in financial ML, credit risk modeling, and production ML systems. Open to consulting, contract work, and partnerships in ML systems, construction technology, and technical leadership—both in the US and internationally.

## Strategic Notes

**For Hiring Managers:** First 2–3 lines are critical. They see ML + financial data + production systems immediately.

**For Recruiters:** Keywords are front-loaded: ML, financial data, credit, pricing, tabular modeling, XGBoost, LightGBM.

**For Consulting/Partnerships:** Final paragraph mentions breadth and international availability without diluting primary message.

**For International Opportunities:** Mentioning Israel, Africa, Caribbean at end signals availability without confusing US-focused recruiters.

**Breadth Signal:** Third paragraph about construction/materials science shows capability breadth but positioned as "background" not primary focus.
