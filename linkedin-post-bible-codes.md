**I Built the First Open-Source JavaScript Replication of the 1994 WRR Bible Codes Experiment — Running Entirely in Your Browser**

In 1994, three mathematicians published a paper in *Statistical Science* claiming statistically significant letter-pattern encodings in the Book of Genesis — names and death dates of 32 famous rabbis, hidden at equidistant letter intervals. P < 0.00002.

The paper ignited decades of debate. But the original software was proprietary, and no open-source replication existed. I grew up fascinated by the intersection of scripture and mathematics. A rigorous statistical claim about the Torah that anyone could test — transparently — felt like something that should exist. So I built it.

**What the tool does:**

11 interactive browser-based research tools for computational analysis of the Torah and Tanakh:

- ELS search across 304,805 Hebrew letters
- Full WRR 1994 replication with permutation testing
- 3D WebGL matrix visualization (Three.js)
- Hebrew calendar date heatmap from 1.74M pre-computed ELS hits

No server. No account. Works offline (PWA).

**Engineering:**

- Web Workers for off-thread computation across hundreds of thousands of skip values
- 39 compressed databases (630 MB raw → 21 MB gzip) with per-letter metadata
- KMP + Boyer-Moore pattern matching with Hebrew final-form normalization
- Custom GIF89a encoder with LZW compression
- Zero npm packages. Zero build steps.

**The honest part:**

My implementation achieves P = 0.0012 (1 in 840). The published result is P = 0.00002 (1 in 62,500) — a 75x gap.

I systematically tested every plausible source: cylindrical wrapping, distance corrections, alternative statistics, domain-of-minimality weighting. Nothing closed the gap.

Then I found the real story: **nobody has independently reproduced WRR's P-value in 30+ years.** The MBBK critique (*Statistical Science*, 1999) couldn't match WRR's distances. When they asked for the original code, WRR "were unable to provide their original computer programs" — the specific program was described by Witztum as "presumably lost." The Hebrew University Aumann Committee ran two formal replications — both non-significant. When Dr. Simcha Emanuel independently prepared appellations for the same 32 rabbis, the effect vanished. MBBK then produced a comparable effect in *War and Peace* through appellation selection alone.

My ~75x gap isn't a bug — it's consistent with an unreproducible result. Every formula and decision is open source. Replication should be transparent, not proprietary.
