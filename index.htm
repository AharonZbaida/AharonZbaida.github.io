                <h3>OANDA NEAT Trading Algorithm</h3>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Self-Directed Project</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Developed a trading algorithm that utilizes NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) for decision-making in the forex market on the OANDA trading platform. The algorithm is designed to learn from historical market data to evolve and optimize trading strategies through genetic algorithms.</p>
                <p>The genetic algorithm dynamically evolves neural network architectures to find solutions, increasing in complexity only as needed to reach goal behaviors. A carefully designed reward function encourages profitable trading behaviors while managing risk and optimizing trade frequency.</p>
                <p>Initial results include performance visualizations and trade logs, showcasing the algorithm's capabilities and areas for further exploration.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, genetic algorithms, neural networks, data analysis.</p>
