                <h3>Financial ML Pipeline</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Financial models require rigorous temporal validation to avoid lookahead bias and account for regime shifts in non-stationary markets.</p>
                <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Built end-to-end pipeline with walk-forward splits, regime-aware cohort analysis, and comprehensive experiment tracking. Implemented versioning for data, code, and model artifacts to ensure reproducibility.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Production pipeline enabling valid out-of-time performance assessment for trading strategies. Framework prevents common pitfalls in financial ML including data leakage and overfitting to historical regimes.</p>

                <h3>Statistical Validation Framework</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Standard cross-validation underestimates variance in financial predictions with autocorrelated outcomes and non-IID data.</p>
                <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Developed bootstrap and permutation testing methods adapted for time-series. Implemented confidence interval estimation and robustness metrics under different market regimes.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Framework enabling statistically sound model selection and honest performance reporting. Prevents overconfidence in backtest results and supports regulatory review.</p>

                <h3>Feature Engineering Service</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Feature drift between training, backtesting, and live deployment creates silent model degradation that compounds over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Created configuration-driven feature computation layer with versioning, point-in-time correctness guarantees, and support for both historical replay and streaming data.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Eliminates lookahead bias and ensures reproducibility across model lifecycle. Single source of truth for features reduces debugging time and prevents production incidents.</p>
